# National Treasure Minesweeper

We started with the intentions of building an application that would display art collections and some how we ended up with Nicolas Cage. National Treasure Minesweeper is a Vanilla Javascript application with a ruby on rails back-end. The National Treasure Minesweeper game takes users on a ride through the National Treasure movie. Steal the constitution, find Ben Franklin's special glasses to read the secret code, then decipher the code to move on to glory but watch out for the boobytraps!
